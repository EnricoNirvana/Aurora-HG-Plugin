//Merged all the connectors in so far

//TODO's

//1: the hypergrid linker in the GridService isn't hooked up yet, so nothing from there will work yet
//InstantMessageService != existing
//What the hell is the Helo stuff?
//HG friend handlers
//Adjusting the HG names is DEFINITELY broken, there's no way that we will do that in Aurora like it is in OpenSim
//Status updates in UserAgentService != existing
//No HGLogin flag for OpenSim heh
